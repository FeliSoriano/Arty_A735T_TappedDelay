2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-2#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock system_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate pin system_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock system_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin system_i/AXITDC_0/U0/TDC/Delay_line/hitQ_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin system_i/AXITDC_1/U0/TDC/Delay_line/hitQ_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net hit0_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): hit0_IBUF_inst/O, system_i/hit0
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#2 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net hit1_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): hit1_IBUF_inst/O, system_i/hit1
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell system_i/AXITDC_0/U0/TDC/control/hitQ_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) system_i/AXITDC_0/U0/TDC/Delay_line/hitQ_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell system_i/AXITDC_1/U0/TDC/control/hitQ_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) system_i/AXITDC_1/U0/TDC/Delay_line/hitQ_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell system_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) system_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#4 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell system_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Area.Core/Implement_Debug_Logic.Master_Core.Debug_Area/Serial_Dbg_Intf.force_stop_cmd_rst_i_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) system_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Area.Core/Implement_Debug_Logic.Master_Core.Debug_Area/Serial_Dbg_Intf.force_stop_TClk_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#5 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell system_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Area.Core/Implement_Debug_Logic.Master_Core.Debug_Area/Serial_Dbg_Intf.normal_stop_cmd_rst_i_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) system_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Area.Core/Implement_Debug_Logic.Master_Core.Debug_Area/Serial_Dbg_Intf.normal_stop_TClk_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on reset relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of system_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on usb_uart_rxd relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of system_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on usb_uart_txd relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of system_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1.
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
